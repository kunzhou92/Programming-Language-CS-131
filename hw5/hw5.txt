I have defined all twelve procedures required. All cases can succeed on those procedures.

null-ld?: If an object which is not listdiff is passed, null-ld? may not check the type and cause an error.
cons-ld: Uses cons twice in the procedure.
length-ld: It is not tailed recursion. Inside the procedure, a help function could be defined to achieve tailed recursion
listdiff ->list: It is not tailed recursion
